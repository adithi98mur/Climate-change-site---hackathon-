                Transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
                Unlike fossil fuels, these energy sources do not contribute to air pollution or climate change. 
                Installing solar panels, supporting wind farms, and encouraging water-based energy production in your community
